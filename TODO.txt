# TODO

MOVE TO INTRO:
How are $\hat{q}$ values to be practically obtained? It is not possible to obtain $\hat{q}$ values for all machine learning techniques. Specifically, this cannot be done for any model which makes only point predictions, and not probabilistic probabilistic predictions. Decision trees are therefore excluded from this discussion. But most popular machine learning techniques produce outputs which can be interpreted as $\hat{q}$ values. For a neural network classifier, the activations of softmax or sigmoid units can be used as $\hat{q}$ values. For ensemble classifiers, the proportions of votes cast for a given label can be interpreted as $\hat{q}$. For a Bayesian model, the posterior probability is naturally interpreted as $\hat{q}$.

for final report, use contributions from introduction with links to resources

talk about CDDM as "undistinguished" rather than poor
runtime and memory wasn't something I cared about as much

2 page report with thesis and paper as appendix

Rescue the bit I cut out of MDD chapter and put it in introduction.

EXPERIMENTS
 - Redo null detector
 - describe bernoulli results in conclusion


CDDM
 - CDDM parameters?
   - CDDM uses fixed window (Uses the same default window size as FHDDM and MDDM of 100.)

MISC
 - Glossary

STYLE
 - "data stream" rather than "datastream"
 - "coronavirus" rather than "corona virus"
 - "un/even time series" rather than "sporadic/regularly spaced domains"
 - names of detectors should be lowercase
 - time steps
