# TODO

EXPERIMENTS
 - Describe CD diagrams
 - Describe SIGIR experiments
 - Use SIGIR results
 - Redo null detector

INTRODUCTION
 - Make sure contributions match results

BACKGROUND
 - Write conclusion
 - Table of other drift detectors
 - Describe more drift detectors
 - Theoretical results
 - Bayesian detectors
 - Operationalisation
 - Taxonomic diagram of drift types

MDD
 - move operationalisation to introduction
 - make sure the motivation reads as a motivation

CDDM
 - Neural networks calibrated
 - Calibration under dataset shift
 - CDDM uses fixed window (Uses the same default window size as FHDDM and MDDM of 100.)

BDD
 - get rid of windowed BDDM?

CONCLUSION
 - Make sure contributions match results

MISC
 - Glossary

STYLE
 - "data stream" rather than "datastream"
 - "coronavirus" rather than "corona virus"
 - "un/even time series" rather than "sporadic/regularly spaced domains"
 - names of detectors should be lowercase
